LAZY TERMINAL
Basic Details

It’s a fake version of VS Code — a fun project that looks like a real code editor but doesn’t actually run any real code.
It just pretends to work and gives funny lazy replies.

Project Description

Lazy Terminal is a web-based parody of the popular Visual Studio Code editor. Designed purely for fun and creativity, this project simulates the look and feel of a real code editor — without actually executing any code.
It includes a mock terminal that responds with humorous, lazy messages instead of real outputs, mimicking the behavior of a terminal that's "too tired" to work. The editor also features a language selector, menu bar, fake debugging, resizable terminal, and file operations (like open/save), all built using standard web technologies.
This project is a playful take on modern developer tools and is ideal for showcasing front-end skills, building UI/UX creativity, and adding humor to hackathons or tech portfolios.

The Problem (Coding is hard. Terminals are scary. Developers are tired.
So, why bother writing real code at all?)

The Solution (Lazy Terminal a completely unproductive code editor simulator that mimics Visual Studio Code’s look... with absolutely no intention of compiling or executing real code.)

I made a fake version of VS Code that looks real but doesn’t do anything serious.
It has a terminal that gives lazy and funny responses instead of actually running code.
You can type fake code, press “Run,” and feel productive without doing real work!
It's for fun — like a joke for programmers.
